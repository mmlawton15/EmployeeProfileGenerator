# Team Page Generator
Project 10 of our bootcamp, a team page generator that shows employee cards and information about their jobs on the webpage.

## What is this?
 - This project was challenge 10 of our bootcamp. We were tasked with creating our first-ever full stack application, applying everything we know. By using this app, users will be able to fill out details about their team members, including Github links, email addresses, ID#s and Office Building #. Practiced OOP and TDD for this challenge.

## Stack?
Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
Backend:
- Javascript
- Markdown for creating a file based on user input
- Node
- Jest for running unit tests
- Inquirer for collecting user input


# How did I make it?
- To make this app, I primarily used Javascript and NodeJS. I used inquirer to prompt the user for the information on their employees. After this was filled out, an HTML file was created (via Markdown), that displayed each team member and details about them. These details included email addresses, Github links, Job Titles, and Schools they had graduated from.
