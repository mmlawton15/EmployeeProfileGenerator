## Team Page Generator

# What is this?
 - This project was challenge 10 of our bootcamp. We were tasked with creating our first-ever full stack application, applying everything we know. By using this app, users will be able to fill out details about their team members, including Github links, email addresses, ID#s and Office Building #.

 # How did I make it?
 - To make this app, I primarily used Javascript and NodeJS. I used inquirer to prompt the user for the information on their employees. After this was filled out, an HTML file was created (via Markdown), that displayed each team member and details about them. These details included email addresses, Github links, Job Titles, and Schools they had graduated from.
